steps to handle the given project:
the first one is data cleaning
1. data cleaning is the most time taking part it took me nearly 1 hour to convert text in to dict and save in to csv format
2. after saving the file know we need to load the file and remove the punctuations we have various methods but i used python built in method
3. next step is to remove the stop words in english like this,that,etc..
4. the above two steps require a loop function
5. after that i imported collections module to find the most repeating words
6. concatanate the maxwords and the finaldata in to a dataframe and you are done.
Happy MachineLearning!!
